	<!-- 
	Be very careful when putting entities or collections into cache. 
	You have to consider many things. Is it really useful?!
	
	Most entities are only meaningful in a collection relationship and putting them into separate caches is not useful.

	eternal:
	Sets whether elements are eternal. If eternal, timeouts are ignored and the element is never expired. 

	timeToIdleSeconds:
	Sets the time to idle for an element before it expires.
	i.e. The maximum amount of time between accesses before an element expires.	Is only used if the element is not eternal.
	Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that an Element can idle for infinity.	The default value is 0.

	timeToLiveSeconds:
	Sets the time to live for an element before it expires.
	i.e. The maximum time between creation time and when an element expires. 	Is only used if the element is not eternal.
	Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that and Element can live for infinity.	The default value is 0.
	
	times are in second.
